  ## Web Application Vulnerability Scanner
The Web Application Vulnerability Scanner is designed to identify common vulnerabilities in websites, such as:

SQL Injection

Cross-site Scripting (XSS)

Insecure HTTP Headers

Directory Listing Enabled

ðŸ”§ Tools & Libraries Used:
requests â€“ For making HTTP requests.

BeautifulSoup â€“ For parsing HTML responses.
The user enters a target URL. The scanner checks for:

Input fields that might be injectable (e.g., forms).

HTML/script content for XSS-like payloads.

HTTP headers like X-Frame-Options, Content-Security-Policy, etc
2. ðŸ”Ž Penetration Testing Toolkit
This module is a modular Python toolkit built to simulate real-world penetration testing. It includes:

âœ… Modules Included:
Port Scanner: Scans target IP addresses for open ports using the socket module and multithreading.

HTTP Brute-Force: Tries various username-password combinations on HTTP Basic Auth using the requests module.

WHOIS Lookup: Retrieves domain registration data using the whois module.

Subdomain Scanner: Attempts DNS resolution of common subdomains using socket.

ðŸ”§ Tools & Libraries Used:
socket, threading â€“ For network operations.

requests, HTTPBasicAuth â€“ For web authentication attacks.

whois â€“ For domain intelligence.

Advanced Encryption Tool â€“ AES-256
This tool implements AES-256 encryption and decryption to protect files or sensitive data.

âœ… Features:
File-based encryption using a strong 256-bit key.

IV (Initialization Vector) for secure randomization.

Password-based key derivation using PBKDF2 (via hashlib).

Simple text-based interface using tkinter (optional) or CLI.

ðŸ”§ Tools & Libraries Used:
pycryptodome (from Crypto.Cipher import AES)

hashlib â€“ For SHA-256 and key derivation.

os â€“ For generating random IVs and secure deletion.

How It Works:
User provides a password.

Key is derived from this password using SHA-256.

File is encrypted in blocks with padding and saved with .enc extension.

Decryption requires the exact password and IV.
